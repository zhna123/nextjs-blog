CSS transition and animation serve different purposes, and I'd like to think that transition is a simpler case of animation.

Here is a Demo I am going to use to illustrate the differences.
<CodePen id="VwgoGXN"/>

### CSS transition:
[transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition) can make an element change its state more smoothly. 

In the Demo, when we hover the mouse over the left button, the background jumped to gray color immediately, while for the middle button, this change happened gradually.

*transition* is used to control state change for a specific element, for example, changing an element's *background-color* from white to gray. It is often used with pseodo classes, like *:hover*, *:focus*, .etc, since they can trigger state change.

*transition* is also a *one time* event - transition, and done.

There are several properties that we can set to control the state transition:
- *transition-property*
  - It could be *all* or a specific property that we want to apply state change, like *color*, *margin*, *box-shadow*, .etc.
- *transition-duration*
  - How long it takes to complete the transition in *s* or *ms*
- [*transition-timing-function*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function)
  - Values include: *ease*, *ease-in*, *ease-out*, *ease-in-out*, *linear*, *step-start*, *step-end*, *steps* function, *cubic-bezier* function
- *transition-delay*
  - Time delay to start transition in *s* or *ms*
- [*transition-behavoir*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-behavior) - experimental

To write it the shorthand way:

`transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay]`

We can also use commas to separate multiple transitions.

### CSS animation:
[animation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation) gives more detailed control over element state transition. We can set multiple intermediate states, specify how many times the transitions should happen, .etc. 

In the Demo above, hovering over the button on the right will trigger a blinking effect, since after the background color changing to gray, there are more state changes followed(defined in *@keyframes at-rule*), as well as the number of times the effect is playing. 

All of these are controlled by different properties. Several of these properties are just like(and behave like) *transition*:
- *animation-duration*
- *animation-timing-function*
- *animation-delay*

Here are some other properties we often use:
- *animation-name*
  - We can use [*@keyframes at-rules*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@keyframes) to define *animation-name* property - this allows us to set intermediate steps for element state change.
- *animation-iteration-count*
  - We can specify a *number* or *infinite* to control how many times the animation would play.
- *animation-direction*
  - Values include: *normal*(default), *reverse*, *alternate*, *alternate-reverse*
- *animation-fill-mode*
  - Values include: *none*(default), *forwards*, *backwards*, *both*
  - Default value will not apply any styles while not executing the animation
  - With *forwards* value, the element will retain the values of the last keyframe(depends on *animation-direction* and *animation-iteration-count*).
  - With *backwards* value, the element will apply the values of the first keyframe(depends on *animation-direction* and *animation-iteration-count*), and retain this during *animation-delay*
  - *both* value following the rules of both *forwards* and *backwards*
- *animation-play-state*
  - Values include: *running*, *paused*

To write it the shorthand way:

`animation: [animation-name] [animation-duration] [animation-timing-function] [animation-delay] [...other properties]`

We can also use commas to separate multiple animations.
