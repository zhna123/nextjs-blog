Flexbox is used for one dimension layout that can be optionally wrapped. 

What helped me most when understanding flex layout is to think of flex items as ONE group on main axis - you can't
set individual locaion for each of them on main axis.

After declaring `display: flex` on an element, all its direct children become flex items. Then you take these flex items as a group,
arrange them on the main axis based on available space, and adjust their alignment individually on cross axis. 

### Alignment
- When properties begin with `justify-`, it is for main axis.
- When properties begin with `align-`, it is for cross axis.
- `justify-content` is used for distributing spaces for the group of flex items on main axis
- `align-content` is used for distributing spaces for the group of flex items on cross axis, when the content wraps
- There is no `justify-self` or `justify-items` because flex items act as a group on main axis

After declaring `display: flex`, the initial behavior of flex items are:
1. display as a row
2. do not wrap
3. do not grow
4. line up at the start of the container

You can control flex direction and wrap by setting corresponding properties `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.
There is a shorthand for setting both: `flex-flow: column wrap`

### Setting how each flex item grows/shrinks inside of a flex container

#### Initial value (`flex: initial`)
```
flex-grow: 0
flex-shrink: 1
flex-basis: auto
```
* You can set these value individually on a flex item, or set: `flex: initial` or `flex: 0 1 auto` on it.

**Note**
  * `flex-basis: auto` means using the item's width or height property
  * `flex-basis: content` means sizing is based on the item's content; For older browser support, the equivalent effect can be had by using 
  `flext-basis: auto` and auto width or height together.

#### Allow items to grow, while larger items get more space (`flex: auto`)
```
flex-grow: 1
flex-shrink: 1
flex-basis: auto
```
* You can set these value individually on a flex item, or set: `flex: auto` or `flex: 1 1 auto` on it.

#### Allow items to grow to be equal sizes (`flex: 1`)
```
flex-grow: 1
flex-shrink: 1
flex-basis: 0
```
* You can set these value individually on a flex item, or set: `flex: 1` or `flex: 1 1 0` on it.
