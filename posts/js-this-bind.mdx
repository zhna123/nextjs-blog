In the context of function, *this* is determined by how a function is called.
For example:

```js
const student = {
  name: "Ann",
  study: function() {
    return `${this.name} is studying.`
  }
}
console.log(student.study()) // 'Ann is studying.'
```

When we write *student.study()*, we say *study* function is called/accessed on the *student* object, therefore, *this* here refers to the *student* object.

Now we may want to save the *student.study* function to a variable, like below:

```js
const studentStudy = student.study
console.log(studentStudy())  // ' is studying.'
```

This time, however, *this.name* didn't print out anything. The reason is when we call the function *without* the object it is called on, `this` loses its context. In this example, we assign *student.study*(the function) to a new variable, and when we call the function *studentStudy*, there's no object associated with it, therefore, *this* doesn't refer to anything anymore. In strict mode, it becomes null or undefined.(In non-strict mode, it will be the *globalThis*)

How do we get "this" back? By using *apply*, *call*, and *bind* methods, we can explicitly call a function with a given *this* value. 

Continue with the same example:

```js
// 'Using call method...Ann is studying.'
console.log(`Using call method...${studentStudy.call(student)}`)
// 'Using apply method...Ann is studying.
console.log(`Using apply method...${studentStudy.apply(student)}`)
```

Instead of invoking the *studentStudy* function, we use *call* or *apply* to specify the object the function will be called on, which is also the *this* value. Now we can get *this.name* again.

We can also use *bind* method, and it returns a new function with the specified *this* value binded.

```js
const binded = studentStudy.bind(student)
console.log(binded())  // 'Ann is studying.'
```

The difference between *apply*, *call* and *bind* is, *apply* and *call* invoke the function, but *bind* returns a new function.

These methods also accept arguments of the function, which can be very useful. I will write about it in another article.
