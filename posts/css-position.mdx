In the realm of CSS element positioning, elements fall into two categories: non-positioned and positioned. 

### Non-Positioned Element
**static position == no position specified**

This is the **default** position for an element. The element will be placed in the normal document flow.

*top*, *right*, *bottom*, *left*, and *z-index* properties have no effect on an element with static position.

### Positioned Element
You are able to use *z-index* on a positioned element. Positioned elements are always on top of non-positioned elements.

There are 4 types of position: relative, absolute, fixed, sticky.

#### relative position
The element with relative position is within the normal document flow. We can use *top*, *right*, *bottom*, *left* properties to set an offset from its normal position in the document flow.

Compare the demo below with the previous demo, and notice how element 2 moved from its normal location.

#### absolute position
The element with absolute position is taken out of the normal document flow. We can use *top*, *right*, *bottom*, *left* properties to define its position relative to its nearest relatively positioned ancestor. If thereâ€™s no such ancestor, it will be positioned relative to the `<html>` element.

Example of element 2 absolutely positioned relative to its nearest relatively positioned ancestor:
<CodePen id="wvYeqvw" />

Example of element 2 absolutely positioned relative to `<html>`:
<CodePen id="mdzwMeo" />

#### fixed position
The element with fixed position is taken out of the normal document flow. It is then positioned relative to the browser viewport with the *top*, *right*, *bottom*, *left* properties. It appears fixed in the same position on the screen.

#### sticky position
The element with sticky position is in the normal document flow, until the content starts to scroll. Then the sticky element will behave like a fixed element. Its offset defined by *top*, *right*, *bottom*, *left* properties is relative to the nearest ancestor that scrolls.
